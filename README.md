# [ZClassic](http://zclassic.org) Desktop GUI Wallet

## Graphical user interface wrapper for the [ZClassic](http://zclassic.org) command line tools

This program provides a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for the ZClassic client tools that acts as a wrapper and 
presents the information in a user-friendly manner.

#### New/Experimental: [ZClassic Desktop GUI Wallet for Windows](https://github.com/vaklinov/zclassic-swing-wallet-ui/blob/master/docs/Readme-Windows.md) is available

## Building, installing and running the Wallet GUI


**For security reasons it is recommended to always build the GUI wallet program from GitHub**
**[source](https://github.com/vaklinov/zclassic-swing-wallet-ui/archive/master.zip).**
The details of how to build it are described below (easy to follow).
Users who insist on downloading a binary release may instead 
use [ZClassic Desktop GUI Wallet - binary release 0.58.2-beta](https://github.com/vaklinov/zclassic-swing-wallet-ui/blob/master/docs/Release_0.58.2-beta.md)


1. Operating system and tools

   As of February 2017 (ZClassic v1.0.5) this program is primarily tested on Linux but also supports
   MacOS/Windows (same limitation as [ZClassic](http://zclassic.org)).   
   The tools you need to build and run the Wallet GUI are Git, Java (JDK7 or later) and 
   Ant. If using Ubuntu Linux, they may be installed via command: 
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir$ sudo apt-get install git default-jdk ant
   ``` 
   For RedHat/CentOS/Fedora-type Linux systems the command is (like):
   ```
   user@centos:~/build-dir$ sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk git ant 
   ```
   The name of the JDK package (`java-1.8.0-openjdk`) may vary depending on the Linux system, so you need to
   check it, if name `java-1.8.0-openjdk` is not accepted.
   If you have some other Linux distribution, please check your relevant documentation on installing Git, 
   JDK and Ant. The commands `git`, `java`, `javac` and `ant` need to be startable from command line 
   before proceeding with build.

2. Building from source code

   As a start you need to clone the zclassic-swing-wallet-ui Git repository:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir$ git clone https://github.com/vaklinov/zclassic-swing-wallet-ui.git
   ```
   Change the current directory:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir$ cd zclassic-swing-wallet-ui/
   ```
   Issue the build command:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir/zclassic-swing-wallet-ui$ ant -buildfile ./src/build/build.xml
   ```
   This takes a few seconds and when it finishes, it builds a JAR file `./build/jars/ZClassicSwingWalletUI.jar`. 
   You need to make this file executable:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir/zclassic-swing-wallet-ui$ chmod u+x ./build/jars/ZClassicSwingWalletUI.jar
   ```
   At this point the build process is finished the built GUI wallet program is the JAR 
   file `./build/jars/ZClassicSwingWalletUI.jar`

3. Installing the built ZClassic GUI wallet

   3.1. If you have built ZClassic from source code:

   Assuming you have already built from source code [ZClassic](http://zclassic.org) in directory `/home/user/zclassic/src` (for 
   example - this is the typical build dir. for ZClassic v1.0.5) which contains the command line tools `zcash-cli` 
   and `zcashd` you need to take the created file `./build/jars/ZClassicSwingWalletUI.jar` and copy it 
   to diretcory `/home/user/zclassic/src` (the same dir. that contains `zcash-cli` and `zcashd`). Example copy command:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir/zclassic-swing-wallet-ui$ cp ./build/jars/ZClassicSwingWalletUI.jar /home/user/zclassic/src    
   ```

4. Running the installed ZClassic GUI wallet

   Before running the GUI you need to start zcashd (e.g. `zcashd --daemon`). The wallet GUI is a Java program packaged 
   as an executable JAR file. It may be run from command line or started from another GUI tool (e.g. file manager). 
   Assuming you have already installed [ZClassic](http://zclassic.org) and the GUI Wallet `ZClassicSwingWalletUI.jar` in 
   directory `/home/user/zclassic/src` one way to run it from command line is:
   ```
   user@ubuntu:~/build-dir/zclassic-swing-wallet-ui$ java -jar /home/user/zclassic/src/ZClassicSwingWalletUI.jar
   ```
   If you are using Ubuntu (or similar ;) Linux you may instead just use the file manager and 
   right-click on the `ZClassicSwingWalletUI.jar` file and choose the option "Open with OpenJDK 8 Runtime". 
   This will start the ZClassic GUI wallet.
